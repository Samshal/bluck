                    <p>MMM is a community of people providing each other financial help on the principle of gratuitousness, reciprocity and benevolence. We use BITCOIN infrastructure in our transactions.

                    In MMM you don’t have to make contracts or pledge your property. In MMM there are no lenders and no debtors. Everything is very simple: one participant asks for help — another one helps.

                    The only thing that MMM demands from its participants is to be honest and kind to each other. You ask for financial help when you need it, you give financial help when you are able to do it.

                    In their transactions MMM participants operate with BITCOINS. It is the best possible way to organize smooth transfers between participants from different countries. Like BITCOIN causes revolution in financial relations, so MMM causes revolution in social relations between people. This combination of MMM and BITCOIN ideas of fair and free financial system makes possible for us to establish significant changes in modern world.</p>
                    
                    <h5><strong>VERY IMPORTANT!</strong></h5>
                    <p>
                    There is no central account, where all the System money flows to (and where it can be easily stolen from :-)). All the money is only on the banking accounts of the participants themselves! On a lot of thousand and million private accounts. Participants transfer each other money directly, without intermediaries! (What are they for? :-)) In fact, MMM only regulates the process and nothing more.

                    I.e. the System completely belongs to people. Without fools! It is a real mutual aid fund, where ordinary people help each other.

You declare the willingness to give help (click in your Personal Office (hereinafter PO) "Provide Help"), after that your account will be credited with Mavro (internal currency of the System). Mavro's amount will start to grow from the moment of deposit. And the rate of growth is 40% in 7 Days. (Calculation of interests occurs every day at 00:00 GMT.) This sum in Mavro shows how much money you can request to withdraw.

                    Guiders of MMM Community can create their own multi-level structures and get a bonus from each donation of every participant in their structures. This is a multi-level bonus, thus a guider can have his own leader whose rank is higher. Guider’s bonus depends on his level in the Community. 
                    For example, if you are Ronald’s guider, Ronald is Maricel’s guider and Maricel is Joseph’s, you will get 5% from Ronald’s donation, 3% from Maricel’s donation and 1% from Joseph’s. If someone will be under Joseph, you will get from him 0.5% and so on. 

                    Guider’s bonuses are credited in the same way as referral, but only from new money deposited and will be available to withdraw after confirmation of your help provided.
