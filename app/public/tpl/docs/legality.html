                    <p>LEGALITY
                    MMM is a people community, which help each other for free, and absolutely consciously, they transfer money directly to each other, from one bank account to another, without any conditions, guarantees and promises. Just only because they want to do that. Because it is a good deal to help each other.
                    It means the Mutual benefit fund as it is.
                    There is no formal organization, no legal person in MMM. And of course there is no central bank account, no other activity in any form. Neither close, nor open. There is nothing! There are only millions and millions of simple participants, simple private persons. And their bank accounts. And nothing more.
                    
                    And of course there is no special registrations, permission and licenses in here.
                    (Permissions and licenses for what and for what reason? For money transfer from one man to another? And whom this licenses and permissions should be given? :-))
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Thus, MMM is absolutely legal and does not break any laws. Because there are only money transfers between private persons and nothing more.
                    It is impossible to forbid MMM. The same way it is impossible to forbid people manage their own money the way they like. Thus they need to forbid the whole private property institution.

                    So everything is absolutely clear with the lawfulness. There are no violations and they won't be! Let's now talk about the other. About honesty. It is important to underline, that MMM doesn't cheat or abuse anyone. In other words it is not a cheat or fraud in any case! Everyone is informed about the possible and impossible risks fully and from the very beginning (And everyone put a mark during the registration, confirming that he was informed about the warning.)
                    
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    MMM itself is more honest (in 100 times!) than any other bank, or any financial institution with their licenses or permissions. Because they all lie to you, hold or keep back something and so on. And only MMM doesn't keep back you in silence, doesn't hide anything and tell everything honestly and openly. “Yes, You take a great risk!... Yes, no guarantees!... Yes, You may loose everything at any moment!...” - Did You hear the same before anywhere? Only in MMM.
                    Honesty, honesty and again honesty! This is the main principle. Honesty, openness and trust. This are the three whales on which the System stands. Have ever seen before the situation, when absolutely unacquainted people transfer money to each other with no reason? Giving them like a gift actually? Millions and millions of people all over the world, every day? Delirium? Fiction? Utopia? No, it is MMM!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Participate! Welcome to the System! Long Live MMM!
